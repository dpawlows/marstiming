marstiming.py

A set of tools for converting between Earth and Mars time.

This module was written following NASA's Mars24 program which is based
on algorithms published in the following papers:

Allison, M. 1997: Accurate analytic representations of solar time and
seasons on Mars with applications to the Pathfinder/Surveyor
missions. Geophys. Res. Lett. 24, 1967-1970, doi:10.1029/97GL01950.

and

aerocentric solar coordinates with improved timing recipes for Mars
seasonal/diurnal climate studies. Planet. Space Sci. 48, 215-235.
